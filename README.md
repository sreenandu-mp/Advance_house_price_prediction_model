# Advance house price prediction model

# Life Cycle in a Datascience Project:
    Data Analysics
    Feature Engineering
    Feature Selection
    Model Building
    Model Deployment
    In this project we have completed data analysics, feature engineering, feture selection, model building.
    
# In Data Exploratory Analysics we will find:
    Missing value
    All the numerical variables
    Distribution of the numerical variables
    Categorical variables
    Cardinality of categorical variables
    Outliers
    Relationship between independent and dependent features(SalePrice)
    
# In Feature Engineering we will handle:
    Missing values
    Temporal variables
    Categorical variables: remove rare labels
    Standarise the values of the variables to the same range
# In Feature Selection: 
    We use Lasso Regression to find necessary feature to predict the output

# In Model Development: 
    We use Linear Regression to predict the output value based on the independent features.
